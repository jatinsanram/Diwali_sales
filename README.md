# Diwali_sales
Welcome to this portfolio practice project of mine where I will be showcasing some of my Python data analysis skills.  I will be using the numpy, pandas and seaborn built in Python libraries in order to clean a large dataset about DiwaliSales and then transform it into something usable for analysis. Finally the seaborn library will be used to create some data visualisations and compare the data.
This will be my project dedicated toward data analytics by using python on jupyter

ThankYou!
